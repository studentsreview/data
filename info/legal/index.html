			<b><u>Dispute Resolution (Arbitration Clause)</u></b></div>
		<br />
		<br />
		<u>Binding Arbitration.</u> You and RMT.com each agree to submit to binding arbitration in the event of a dispute, controversy or claim (each, a &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;) arising out of or in connection with these Terms, your or RMT.com&rsquo;s rights and obligations under these Terms, the Site, the use of the Site, and/or the information, services and/or products that may be provided by or through or in connection with the Site. The arbitration will be held in Maryland before one arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class action. You expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a dispute as a class action. You also expressly waive your right to a jury trial. You may select one of the following arbitration organizations and its applicable rules: the National Arbitration Forum, Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405-0191 (www.arb-forum.com), or JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center Suite 1100 San Francisco, CA 94111 (www.jamsadr.com). If you fail to select an arbitration organization within 30 days after notice from RMT.com, RMT.com may select the organization. You may obtain a copy of the rules of each organization by contacting the organization. In the event that any Dispute cannot be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of any such organization, such event shall not affect the enforceability of this clause so long as the Dispute may be submitted to binding arbitration with one of the organizations. You and RMT.com shall agree on one arbitrator to conduct the arbitration and the arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the applicable rules. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless such fees are awarded by the arbitrator to the prevailing party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate RMT.com&rsquo;s intellectual property rights, RMT.com may seek (and you will not contest) injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the state of Maryland, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<br />
		<br />
		<u>Arbitration Final.</u> The arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state law concerning arbitration, governs all arbitration under this clause. Any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. If any part of this clause, other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain enforceable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the waiver of class action rights contained herein is not enforceable as to any person or persons, such non-enforceability shall apply to such person or persons only, and all other persons shall continue to be governed by the Arbitration Clause.<br />
		<br />
		<u>Giving Up Right of Class Action.</u> These Terms provide that all Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration and not in court or by jury trial. IF A DISPUTE IS ARBITRATED, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST RMT.COM INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS INCLUDES GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AS SET FORTH IN ANY STATE STATUTE.<br />
		<br />
		<u>California Residents.</u> If you are a California resident, to the extent permitted by California law, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor&rdquo; as well as any other unknown claims under California Civil Code Section 1542 or any statute or common law principle of similar effect.<br />
		<br />
		<div align="center">
			<b><u>Choice of Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; Waiver of Trial By Jury</u></b></div>
		<br />
		<br />To the maximum extent permitted by law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, excluding any law or conflicts of law principle that would apply the law of another jurisdiction. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY OPT OUT OF THE MARYLAND UNIFORM COMPUTER TRANSACTIONS ACT (&ldquo;MUCITA&rdquo;) AS PERMITTED BY SECTION 22-104 OF MUCITA. To the extent a Dispute is not governed by the Arbitration Clause, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in the State of Maryland in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site or under these Terms; provided, however, that in the event RMT.com is sued or joined by a third party in any other court or in any other forum in respect of any matter which may give rise to a claim by RMT.com hereunder, you consent to the jurisdiction of such court or forum over any claim which may be asserted by RMT.com therein. You irrevocably consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by such courts in any such action. In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, you irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that you may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon you and may be enforced in any court in which you are subject to a jurisdiction by a suit upon such judgment. To the Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these terms and conditions, including without limitation this paragraph. To the extent a claim is not governed by the Arbitration Clause, RMT.com and you each hereby waive the right to a trial by jury in any court and in any suit, action or proceeding, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise, in which any such party is a party, as to any claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms, your or RMT.com&rsquo;s rights and obligations under these Terms, the Site, use of the Site, and/or the services and/or products that may be provided by or through or in connection with the Site.<br />

The failure of RMT.com to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of RMT.com&rsquo;s right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of these Terms. These Terms shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties to these Terms and their respective successors, heirs, legatees, personal representatives and permitted assigns.

		<br />Our users are anonymous. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that anonymity of speech is protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution (see McIntyre v. Ohio, 514 U.S. at 337; Talley v. State of California, 362 U.S. 60). United States courts also recognize the right to speak anonymously &#150; AND have held that the right extends to speech on the Internet. When courts have ordered disclosure of the name of an anonymous user, a litigant must show that its need for identifying information outweighs the user's constitutional right. RateMyTeachers.com recognizes this right to anonymity.<br />
